You should install the package global

```bash
$ npm install project-creator -g
```

If you want to quickly create a project for training something features you may run the script in your test directory

```bash
$ project-creator
```

Then 3 folders(styles, js, img) will be created in your folder. Folders "styles" and "js" will have files "style.css" and "main.js"
